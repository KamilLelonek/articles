Have you ever wanted to run some of your **ruby program as a background service**? There are a couple ways to do that starting from simple `&`, through `runit` to complex services.

This tutorial is intended to give you a quick overview of `upstart`, which is one of the possible solutions to run and manage your background processes.

## What is upstart?
According to [upstart homepage](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/index.html):

> Upstart is an event-based replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the system is running.

> It was originally developed for the Ubuntu distribution, but is intended to be suitable for deployment in all Linux distributions as a replacement for the venerable System-V init.

## How to use it?

[In properly set up production environment there is no ruby version manager](http://blog.arkency.com/2012/11/one-app-one-user-one-ruby/). Using **one ruby per user** makes your script extremely easy to run and there's no need to provide any special configuration here.

Unfortunately, there are still some environments, which use `rvm` or `rbenv` so, to make this article comprehensive, we need to show how to configure at least one of them.

Let's choose `rvm` for managing rubies. You'll need to create [wrapper](https://rvm.io/integration/init-d) for ruby executable to be accessible from `my_program.conf`.

According to [rvm website](https://rvm.io/rubies/alias) it can be done via simple command:


```
#!ruby
rvm alias create my_program ruby-2.0.0-p247
```

Now your ruby bin can be found under:

```
#!ruby
/usr/local/rvm/wrappers/my_program/ruby
```	

Then, create configuration file that contains script to be executed in a background job:

```
#!ruby
vim /etc/init/my_program.conf
```

## How to write it?
	
  a) You have to tell your script when to run and `start on` command is used for that. The syntax looks like:

```
#!ruby
start on <your_command>
```


`<your_command>` can be for example:


```
#!ruby
	- startup				# start a job as early as possible
	- filesystem 			# start after all filesystems are mounted
	- started networking 	# start after network is connected
	- custom_command 		# start job only on demand after explicitly run by user
```

  b) In the same way you can define `stop on` command.
	
  c) The very next command is `respawn` which tells your process to run after being killed.
	
  d) You can execute your program right now, and there are two way of doing so. `execute` is one-liner keyword to run simple script, block


```
#!ruby		
		script
		# ...
		end script
```
		
is for multiline code.
	
  e) our `conf` file might look like:


```
#!ruby	
		start on my_event
		respawn
		script
			cd /home/my_program/
			/usr/local/rvm/wrappers/my_program/ruby my_program
		end script
```
		
## How to run it?

As you might have guessed, there a couple ways to do that.

  a) when we run our script on custom event you can run it like

```
#!ruby	
sudo initctl emit my_event
```

  b) if you want use old service syntax you can do:

```
#!ruby	
sudo service my_program start
```
		
  c) you can do also:

```
#!ruby	
sudo start my_program
```

You can execute the basic commands like `start`, `stop`, `restart` and `status` directly without preceding them with `initctl`.

I recommend you to take a look at [initctl](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/quantal/en/man8/initctl.8.html), which offers quite nice helpers like e.g. `list`, which lists all registered services and their state.

If you want to see execution logs (to check whether everything goes correctly) there's a handy way to display them:

```
#!ruby
		sudo tail -f /var/log/upstart/my_program.log
```

## Disclaimer

Although [`upstart` has been sunset in favour of `systemd`](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1149530#p1149530) as a default init system, it is still used for other use cases. What is more, [`systemd` adoption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd#Adoption) is wider than [`upstart`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart#Adoption) across Linux distributions. However, there are [some fallacies](http://monolight.cc/2011/05/the-systemd-fallacy/) about the former, which is thought to be more [complex](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/daemon.html) than intended. Moreover there are still not many [resources](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd#Writing_custom_.service_files) and [tutorials](http://patrakov.blogspot.com/2011/01/writing-systemd-service-files.html) that well explains `systemd` and provide step-by-step solutions to write and run background scripts. We encourage you to dive into both of them and choose by yourself which one is more suitable and less complex for your own needs.

## Update

If you want to know even more about `upstart`, there's [an another blogpost](http://blog.arkency.com/2014/07/ruby-background-processes-with-upstart-user-jobs/) with additional features involving upstart user jobs. See you then!
